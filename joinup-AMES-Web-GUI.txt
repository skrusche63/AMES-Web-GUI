Name:
Ad-hoc Mobile Ecosystem - Web GUI development framework

Short Name:
AMES-Web-GUI

Abstract:
AMES Web GUI is the next OSS contribution of German IT-Amt Bw and is the client-side part of a new Ad-hoc Web application development framework.


Full description:

One of the main objective in the transformation process of the German Bundeswehr is to achieve the capability for Net-Centric Operations in joint and multinational scenarios. 
To gain this capability, it is essential to establish a context sensitive Shared Space of information, based on open international standards and fulfilling advanced operational and security requirements. 

After the successful releases of the ebXML OMARv32-SAML family on JoinUp, this release is the next significant step on a roadmap towards an Ad-hoc Web application development framework built upon the Shared Space.

This project is part of that framework and represents the client-side functionality organized in reusable building blocks to implements secure SmartGWT based applications.

The AMES Web GUI project is part of a family of other releases building the overall application development framework, see dependencies.

This project was funded by the German IT-Amt Bundeswehr under the contract E/IB1S/CA018/AF020 and released under GNU Public License Version 3 (GPLv3). 

The examples of the target audience include Enterprise, Government, NATO/PfP Partners, NGOs, public authorities, disaster relief management, etc.
